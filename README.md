## Technologies Used

- React 
- Tailwind CSS
- NewsAPI
- Firebase

This project has beeen created for learning purposes. Inital plan has been to deploy it to the Firebase, however only later in the project I realized that the News API Developer tier allows only fetching the data from the API in development and testing phase, however not in production so I decided to keep it that way. See the operating website in development above. 

Happy coding!
